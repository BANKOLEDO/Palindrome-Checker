# Palindrome Checker

This project is a simple JavaScript application that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Features

- Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- Alerts the user if no value is entered.
- Displays the result of the palindrome check.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a web browser


## Usage

1. Enter a string into the text input field.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. The application will alert you if no value is entered.
4. The result will display whether the entered string is a palindrome or not.

## Examples

- Input: "A" → Output: "A is a palindrome"
- Input: "eye" → Output: "eye is a palindrome"
- Input: "_eye" → Output: "_eye is a palindrome"
- Input: "race car" → Output: "race car is a palindrome"
- Input: "not a palindrome" → Output: "not a palindrome is not a palindrome"
- Input: "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama" → Output: "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama is a palindrome"
- Input: "never odd or even" → Output: "never odd or even is a palindrome"
- Input: "nope" → Output: "nope is not a palindrome"
- Input: "almostomla" → Output: "almostomla is not a palindrome"
- Input: "My age is 0, 0 si ega ym." → Output: "My age is 0, 0 si ega ym. is a palindrome"
